            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I completed my diploma in Computer Science Engineering (2020-2023) and am currently pursuing a B.Tech degree in Computer Science Engineering. Iâ€™m actively working on building my skills and scaling meaningful projects. Recently, Iâ€™ve started participating in hackathons and have completed two so far, with plans to attend many more in the near future. In the past, I have explored SaaS applications and practical tech solutions, interned at notable companies, and continue to explore opportunities for growth in the tech industry.</p>
